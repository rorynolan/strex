# str_alphord_nums works

    The non-number bits of every string must be the same.
    i The first pair of strings with different non-number bits are strings 1 and 3.
    x They are 'abc9def55' and 'abc10xyz7'.

    It should either be the case that all strings start with numbers or that none of them do.
    x  String number 1 '0abc9def55g' does start with a number whereas string number 2 'abc10def7g0' does not start with a number.
