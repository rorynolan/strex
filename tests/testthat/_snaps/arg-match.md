# match_arg() works

    `arg` must be a prefix of exactly one element of `choices`.
    x Your `arg`, 'A', is a prefix of two or more elements of `choices`.
    i The first two of these are 'Apples' and 'Avocados'.

    `choices` must not have duplicate elements.
    i Since you have set `ignore_case = TRUE`, elements 3 and 7 of your `choices`, ('Bananas' and 'bananas') are effectively duplicates.

    `choices` must not have duplicate elements.
    * Element 8 of your `choices`, 'Pears', is a duplicate.

    `y` must be a prefix of exactly one element of `choices`.
    i Your first 50 `choices` are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
    x Your `y`, 'a', is not a prefix of any of your `choices`.

    You used `match_arg()` without specifying a `choices` argument.
    i The only way to do this is from another function where the `arg` has a default setting. This is the same as `base::match.arg()`.
    i See the man page for `match_arg()`.
    i See the vignette on argument matching: enter `vignette('argument-matching', package = 'strex')` at the R console.
