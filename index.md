There are some things that I wish were easier with the `stringr` or
`stringi` packages. The foremost of these is the extraction of numbers
from strings. `stringr` makes you figure out the regex for yourself;
`strex` takes care of this for you. There are many more useful
functionalities in `strex`. In particular, there’s a `match_arg()`
function which is more flexible than the base `match.arg()`.
Contributions to this package are encouraged: it is intended as a
miscellany of string manipulation functions which cannot be found in
`stringi` or `stringr`.

The github repo of `strex` is at <https://github.com/rorynolan/strex>.

## Installation

[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
