There are some things that I wish were easier with the `stringr` or `stringi` packages. The foremost of these is the extraction of numbers from strings. `stringr` lets you figure this out the regex for yourself; `strex` takes care of this for you. There are many more useful functionalities in `strex`. In particular, there's a `match_arg()` function which is more flexible than the base `match.arg()`. Contributions to this package are encouraged: it is intended as a miscellany of string manipulation functions which cannot be found in `stringi` or `stringr`.
