# strex <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

There are some things that I wish were easier with the `stringr` or
`stringi` packages. The foremost of these is the extraction of numbers
from strings. `stringr` lets you figure this out the regex for yourself;
`strex` takes care of this for you. There are many more useful
functionalities in `strex`. In particular, there’s a `match_arg()`
function which is more flexible than the base `match.arg()`.
Contributions to this package are encouraged: it is intended as a
miscellany of string manipulation functions which cannot be found in
`stringi` or `stringr`.
