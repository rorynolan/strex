\title{\code{strex}: extra string manipulation functions}
\description{
There are some things that I wish were easier with the \code{stringr} or \code{stringi}
packages. The foremost of these is the extraction of numbers from strings.
\code{stringr} makes you figure out the regex for yourself; \code{strex} takes care of
this for you. There are many more useful functionalities in \code{strex}. In
particular, there's a \code{match_arg()} function which is more flexible than the
base \code{match.arg()}. Contributions to this package are encouraged: it is
intended as a miscellany of string manipulation functions which cannot be
found in \code{stringi} or \code{stringr}.
